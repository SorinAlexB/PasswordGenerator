# PasswordGenerator
This program is a simple password generator that generates passwords based on the number of characters that you desire. In this project I used secrets module and string module. For using all the letters in the alphabet and also the special characters and digits I applied .ascii_letters, .digits and .punctuation constants. Lastly, for the best result of randomness I used the secrets module.


Firstly, using the constants from string module I created a list which has every letter in the alphabet, all the digits and also all punctuation items. After this step the user will provide us a value which will indicate the number of desired characters for password, and in the final step the program will create the password randomly, using a loop. In the end the password will be displayed in console.
